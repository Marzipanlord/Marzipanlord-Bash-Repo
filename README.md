This repo is for my basic bash scripts that I use for linux terminal operations.
These scripts are all very basic and I'm sure that they could be done much better by someone who, unlike me, was not entirely new to bash.
You are free to use these scripts as much as you like and make whatever changes you may see fit.
This isn't a serious effort to make something useful, this is just a bit of fun for me to do in my spare time.

For those who have never cloned a git-repo before, this is how to install my repo:

1: Go to command line and create a new directory where you want to clone this repository to.
2: Enter this command without the quotation marks: "git clone https://github.com/Marzipanlord/Marzipanlord-Bash-Repo"
